# NearBeach
## What is NearBeach?
NearBeach is a project and task management tool (PATMT) with a basic customer relationship management tool to help you manage your projects and tasks. The phillosophy of NearBeach is to be easy to install and use, be open sourced, be flexible, and aimed at small/personal organisations to large enterprises. Each new module brought to NearBeach expands it's capability tenfold and brings it closer to a competing product.

## Features
NearBeach's main focus is to create both projects and tasks. Each task can then be assigned to as many projects required (sometimes multiple projects will need to have the same task completed). Each project and task can also be assigned to multiple users to complete.
