# NearBeach
NearBeach is currently being built as a project and task management tool (PATMT) with a basic customer relationship management tool (CRM). Its goal is to be an easy to install and use open sourced tool aimed at small/personal organisations to large enterprises. NearBeach is currently being built on the Django webframe work.

NearBeach will have many modules included within it to help track projects/tasks

* Opportunities
* Customers
* Costs
* Documentation upload (DU)/Documentation Cloud Links (DCL)

Please note - most of these features are still currently being constructed in the Alpha stage.
