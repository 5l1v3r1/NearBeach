    Issue
    ~~~~~
    We do not want the user to pick an organisation and then a customer from a different organisation. This function
    will limit which customers are seen in the "Customer" field to those only belonging to that particular organisation.
    This will work similarly to the Country/Region javascript.

    Method
    ~~~~~~
    1.) Extract out the Organisation ID from the organisation field
    2.) Loop through the customer fields and hide those who are not associated to the organisation
