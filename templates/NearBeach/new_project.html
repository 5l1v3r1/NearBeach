After here we will assign this project to a person. From there we can assign tasks to the project :)<br />
We will also need to assign contacts to the project. This can be done using a simple list functionality. :) We can assign multiple contacts to the one project. I am thinking having a simple input with a list of selected contacts already in a listbox. This can be done in JAVASCRIPT I think. I will have to determine this.<br />
However that said - if we are able to send the user strait to the created project we will not need to worry about contacts.<br />
We will need to program in which group(s) we are assigning the project to.
